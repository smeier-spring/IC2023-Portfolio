  You head over to the tree, and you see that in the tree is a very strange bird. It looks like an infant, it's wings appear to be made of pure gold.
  The bird doesn't seem weary of humans and you could make a lot of money if you took it back with you.<br><br><br> 
  Do you take the bird, or leave it?
