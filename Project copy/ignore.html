        <h3>You ignore the strange singing and continue walking through the forest.
            After awhile you feel a sharp pain in your back. An elf shot you with a poisoned arrow, and you collapse. 
            You awaken bound to a pole, hanging over a fire. You are assaulted by the smell of your own roasting flesh.<br>
            The singing from earlier and dancing elves surround you.<br><br>
            Eventually You die.<br><br>
            Incidently, the elves had a wonderful feast that night.
