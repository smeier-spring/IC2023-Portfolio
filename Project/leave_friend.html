  <h3>You choose to leave your friend behind, and continue into the woods. As you walk away you hear your friend screaming in pain. <br><br>
    You start running since you do NOT want to get involved with what that is.<br><br>
    After travelling for awhile you hear strangely beautiful singing coming from the trees a little ways off the trail. 
  Do you investigate the music, or do you ignore it? </h3>
