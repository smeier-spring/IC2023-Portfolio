    You ignore your friend and keep climbing, your friend reluctantly follows you. They quickly start complaining again, to your extreme annoyance.
    And then their sweat-drench hands slip off the ladder. You watch them fall all the way back down to the ground far below.
    Your friend is dead, not that you care, and you keep climbing.<br><br><br>
    When you get to the top the ladder you are exhausted. In the distance you see a giant tree that shimmers incandescently.<br><br><br>
    What do you do?
