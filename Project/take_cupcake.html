    You take the elves' cupcake and eat it. It's delicious and you eat some more. Afterwords you realize in horror that a strange feeling has settled over your body. 
    The elves order you to kneel, and your body moves on it's own to obey their command. 
    For the rest of your life you are subjected to unspeakable horrors that we would get demonitized for explaining.
    <br><br>
    !!!Congratulations!!!<br>
    You Survived,<br><br>This is the happy ending.
