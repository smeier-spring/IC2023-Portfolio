  <h3>You and your friend wander through the forest for 10 minutes before you finally approach the cliff. 
    The two of you see a ladder going straight up the rock face, and you also see a sloping path that gently arches up the side of the mountain. 
    Do you take the faster and more dangerous ladder, or the slower and safer winding path?</h3>
